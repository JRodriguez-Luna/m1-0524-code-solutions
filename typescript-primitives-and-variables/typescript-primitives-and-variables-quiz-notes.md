## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  -> Variables are the fundamental concepts used across all programming languages to store data.

- How do you **declare** a variable?
  -> You declare a variable using the var, let, const.
  --> Best practice is to use the const except when you are manipulating the value/data.

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  -> initializing a variable requires us to use the assignment operator '='.

- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  -> Letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but must start with a letter, $, or \_.

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  -> Meaning that canalization matters.
  --> Two variables with the same name, but with different capitalization, are treated as
  two separate variables.

- What is the purpose of a string?
  -> A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.

- What is the purpose of a number?
  -> A number in TS are used to represent both integer and floating-point values.
  -> single number, and can be written with or without decimals.

- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  -> Booleans in TS represent one of two values: true or false.
  --> Typically used in conditional testing where you need to decide which path the code
  to execute based on the truthiness of a condition.

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
  -> The assignment operator used to assign a value/data to a variable.

- How do you update the value of a variable?
  -> Updating the value of a variable involves assigning a new value to the variable using the
  assignment operator '='.

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  -> Null: intentionally used to represent 'no value' or 'empty value'.
  --> Assigned explicitly to a variable.

  -> undefined: Assigned to a variable that has been declared but not initialized with a value.
  --> Represents the absence of value or "not defined".

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  -> Adding labels to console logs in the browser helps in better organization, understanding, and
  debugging of code.

- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
  1. string: representing a sequence of characters to represent text.
  2. number: represent a number; integer or float.
  3. boolean: represents two values: true or false; used in conditional statements.
  4. undefined: a variable declared but not initialized with a value.
  5. null: represents intentional absence of any object value.
