## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?

  > A loop repeats a block of code many times, making your code simpler and easier to manage.
  > It's useful for doing repetitive tasks like going through a list of items or a collection of data.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?

  > The condition expression in a loop checks if the loop should keep running.
  > If it’s true, the loop continues; if it’s false, the loop stops.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?

  > Iteration means one complete run of the loop, from start to end of the code inside the loop.

  > > Refers to the process of executing the code block within a loop once.
  > > Each time the loop runs is considered an iteration.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?

  > It gets evaluated before each iteration.

  > > Condition = 'true' = run.
  > > Condition = 'false' = stop.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

  > It gets evaluated once before the first iteration of the loop begins.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

  > It gets evaluated before each iteration.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

  > final expression gets evaluated after each iteration, right before the condition expression is evaluated again
  > for the next iteration.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?

  > The 'break' statement exits a loop immediately, without waiting for the condition to be 'false'.

- What does the `++` increment operator do?

  > '++' operator adds one to current value of a variable.

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  > Using a 'for...in' loop.
