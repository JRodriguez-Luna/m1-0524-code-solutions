## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  > A breakpoint is a specific screen width at which a website's layout changes to provide the best possible user experience. It allows different styles to be applied at different screen sizes, making the website responsive.

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  > Using a percentage width allows the column to resize proportionally to the parent container, making the layout more flexible and adaptable to different screen sizes. This helps maintain a consistent look across various devices.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
  > In CSS, the rule that comes last in the stylesheet is the one that gets applied if there are conflicting styles. If the rules for a smaller min-width come after the rules for a larger min-width, the smaller min-width rules will override the larger ones due to their position in the stylesheet.
