## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?

  > Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width of their container. They stack vertically, one after the other.

- How do inline elements affect the document flow?

  > Inline elements do not start on a new line. They flow within a line of text, sitting next to each other horizontally.

- What are the default width and height of a block-level element?

  > The default width is 100% of the container's width, and the height is as tall as its content.

- What are the default width and height of an inline element?
  > The width and height are only as large as the content inside them.

## Notes

Block-level Content and Inline-level Content

> two important concepts in web development that determine how elements are displayed and interact with each other.

Block-level - elements that typically start on a new line and stretch out to the full width available. - creates distinct blocks of content on a webpage and often include structural elements > heading > paragraphs > lists > divs

    Can contain other block-level elements.

    Key Characteristics:
    > Starts on a new line.
    > Occupies the full width available.
    > Can contain other block-level and inline-level elements.

Inline-level Content - elements that DO NOT start on a new line and only occupy the space bounded by
the tags defining the element. - typically used for smaller units of content within block-level elements.
Ex of Inline-level elements: > spans > links > images > emphasis; <em> and <strong>

    Key Characteristics:
    > Does NOT start on a new line.
    > Occupies ONLY the space bounded by the tags defining the element.
    > Can be nested within block-level elements but cannot contain block-level elements.
